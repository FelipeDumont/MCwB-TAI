Readme for Topics in artificial intelligence, Proyect task 1.

This folder should contain the next 4 folders:

* Greedy
* Instancias
* Instancias Other
* Later

The corresponding folder should be set up with the "Greedy" for the compilation of the code we will use the make and make clean if necesary, the excecution of the make will generate a Greedy excecutable.

To execute Greedy, we will use the next examples
// ./Greedy new "../Instancias Other/5clusters.dat.1" 548792
// ./Greedy old "../Instancias/eil22.txt" 548792

The first argument indicates the type of file used, since the structures for the MCwB has more than 1 type of file, we divide them with the first element, the next element indicates the file to be used, all the files in "instancias" are old files, the last input is the seed to be used by the algorithm.

The excecution of the examples will give the results in the format used for this problem, but with the solution obtained by a simple greedy algorithm
